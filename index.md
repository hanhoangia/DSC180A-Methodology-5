1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting topic covered in my domain so far is hypergraph neural network.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I want to explore the topic of dimensionality reduction in graphs for advancement in graph analysis and better efficiency in the task of graph machine learning.
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
Our Quarter 1 project involves replicating a paper on congestion prediction in a chip design using a hypergraph representation with multiple layers of virtual nodes as aggregated nodes. I am interested in investigating a dimensionality reduction solution with the use of the concept of virtual nodes in graphs.
3. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am also interested in applying my knowledge in recommender systems for link prediction in the aforementioned graph representation as a way of predicting congestion in a chip design.
