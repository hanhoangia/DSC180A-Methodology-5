1. **The most interesting topic covered in my domain so far is hypergraph neural network.**
2. **I want to explore the topic of dimensionality reduction in graphs for advancement in graph analysis and better efficiency in the task of graph machine learning.**
3. **Our Quarter 1 project involves replicating a paper on congestion prediction in a chip design using a hypergraph representation with multiple layers of virtual nodes as aggregated nodes. I am interested in investigating a dimensionality reduction solution with the use of the concept of virtual nodes in graphs.**
3. **I am also interested in applying my knowledge in recommender systems for link prediction in the aforementioned graph representation as a way of predicting congestion in a chip design.**
